### Mongo-install 
```
docker run -d --name mongodb --network my-network -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -v mongo-data:/data/db_mongo:latest
```

### Mongo-express-install
```
docker run -d --name mongo-express --network my-network -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=password -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb -e ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME=admin -e ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD=pass123 -p 8081:8081 mongo-express:latest

## If I am using bind mount volume 
- `mkdir mongo-data`
- cd  mongo-data
- pwd

```
docker run -d --name mongodb --network my-network -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -v /home/ubuntu/mongo-data:/data/db_mongo:latest

### Multi-stage Docker 
The idea is to separate build-time dependencies (compilers, SDKs, tools) from runtime dependencies, so the final image stays small, secure, and clean.
## Why do we need it:
1. Small final image size:
    - you might need compilers `node-modules` in your build time but you don't need it in your runtime
    - But in production, you only need the compiled output.
    - Multi-stage removes unnecessary stuff â†’ final image is lightweight
2. Security:
    - Build tools, compilers, and secrets stay in the build stage.
    - Final image has only whatâ€™s needed to run â†’ reduces attack surface
3. Faster build & deployment:
    - Smaller images are faster to push/pull.
    - Faster CI/CD pipelines and deployments.
### ðŸ”¹ Multi-Stage Build Examples
#### Golang app
```
# ---- Build Stage ----
FROM golang:1.21 AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Build the binary
RUN go build -o myapp main.go

# ---- Runtime Stage ----
FROM alpine:3.18
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .

ENTRYPOINT ["./myapp"]
```
#### React/Next.js frontend with Nginx
```Dockerfile
# ---- Build Stage ----
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# ---- Runtime Stage ----
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```
### Deep Dive Concepts
- Named Stages
    - AS builder lets you reference the stage later:
```
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```
- Target Builds

    - You can build only up to a specific stage:
```
docker build --target builder -t myapp-builder .
```
## Witout Muti-stage
```
FROM node:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install 
COPY . .
RUN npm run build 
EXPOSE 3000 
CMD ["npm","run","start'] 
```

### multi-stage
```
FROM node:alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/build /app/build
RUN npm install -g serve
EXPOSE 3000
CMD["serve","-s","build","-l","3000"]
```
### Java 
```
FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk11 
EXPOSE 8080
ENV APP_NAME /usr/src/app
COPY target/*.jar $APP_NAME/app.jar
WORKDIR $APP_HOME
CMD["java","-jar","app.jar"]
```
### multi-stage Dockerfile
```
# --------------------------
# Stage 1: Build the JAR file
# --------------------------
FROM maven:3.8.7-openjdk-11 AS builder

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy Maven configuration first (better caching for dependencies)
COPY pom.xml .

# Pre-download dependencies (only if pom.xml changes)
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy source code
COPY src ./src

# Build the application (skip tests for faster build in CI/CD)
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# --------------------------
# Stage 2: Run the application
# --------------------------
FROM eclipse-temurin:11-jre AS production
# ^ Slimmer runtime-only image (no need for full JDK in prod)

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy built jar from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Set default command
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]

```
### Base image for build stage

``FROM maven:3.8.7-openjdk-11 AS builder``


- Includes Maven + JDK 11 â†’ required for building Java apps.

- We name the stage builder.

### Working directory

`WORKDIR /app`


- All operations happen inside /app.

### Dependency caching

`COPY pom.xml .`
`RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B`


- Copies only pom.xml first, so Maven can cache dependencies.

- Saves time in CI/CD because dependencies wonâ€™t be re-downloaded unless pom.xml changes.

### Copy application source code

`COPY src ./src`
- Copies source files into the container.

### Build JAR

`RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests`

- Builds the JAR file into target/.

- Skips tests (optional â€” remove -DskipTests if you want tests to run).

### Slim runtime image

`FROM eclipse-temurin:11-jre AS production`


- Uses a smaller JRE-only image for running (lighter than full JDK).

- This keeps your final Docker image small and secure.

```Copy built JAR

COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar


Expose port

EXPOSE 8080```


Exposes port for the application (change if your app uses another).

Start the app

CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]


Entry point for running your Spring Boot (or any Java JAR) app.
